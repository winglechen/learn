Ansoff distinguished four growth strategies: market penetration (selling more of the same products in current markets), market development (selling more of the same products in new markets), product development (selling new products in current markets), and diversification (selling new products in new markets).",

Customers assess an innovation by the risk and uncertainty of adopting it, which is based on its relative advantage over an existing product, its compatibility with values and experiences, its complexity, its \"trialability,\" and its observability. This assessment influences an individual customer's rate of adoption, generally yielding five dominant patterns of innovation adoption curves: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards.",

    "description": "Taking inspiration from the world of biology, Fine argues that each industry has its evolutionary life cycle, or \"clockspeed,\" measured by the rate at which it introduces new products, processes, and organization structures. As geneticists study the fruit fly to gain insight into the evolutionary paths of all animals, managers in any industry can learn from the \"industrial fruit flies\"—Internet services, personal computers, and multimedia entertainment—that evolve at breakneck speed. Fine illustrates how competitive advantage is lost or gained in the management of the dynamic web of relationships that run throughout a company's chain <br/>of suppliers, distributors, and alliance partners.",

After identifying another viable strategic position in its industry, the company must manage both positions simultaneously. Designing a successful strategy is a never-ending requirement, and a company is challenged to answer the who-what-and-how questions in order to remain flexible and ready to adjust its strategy if feedback from the market is unfavorable.",
